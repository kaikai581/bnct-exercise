# g4-xsec-printer
An exporting utility to print and store calculated geant4 cross section to file.
## Upstream Template
This program is based on the geant4 extended example [Hadr00](https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/tree/master/examples%2Fextended%2Fhadronic%2FHadr00). The original Hadr00 will be uploaded as the initial commit for easy diff for parts of the code that are required to be customized.

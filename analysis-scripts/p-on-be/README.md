# Analysis of the proton-on-beryllium simulation data
The output of the `beam-on-target` simulation is a ROOT file with two trees.
One records all secondary particles generated from the primary protons and the subsequent secondary particles. The other records nuclear processes through which secondary particles are produced. Since this simulation is for studying generated neutrons, I will be focusing on the interesting features in neutron kinematic variables in the following sections.
## Neutron kinetic energy distribution
The first feature that catches my eye is this neutron kinetic energy distribution.
